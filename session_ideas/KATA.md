# KATA

In TDD style, do an exercise.

Write the class implementation and the tests.

number of participants: 2 to 4

duration: ~2 hours

setup: shared session on an IDE (rubymine / vscode / ...)

## How

One at a time (few minutes session):
- add a (failing) test,
- write the relative implementation,
- refactor things eventually

## Tips to chose a good kata

- The kata solution must be incremental by tiny steps (few minutes)
- Good difficulty balance, adapted to the level of the participants
- The spec must be short and understandable
- It's interesting to have extension options ("to go further") to fill the session duration

## Sources

Some kata specs can be found in the 'katas' folder.
