# REFACTORING

Take a class and refactor it for:
- better readability
- better maintainability
- better performances
- better what you want

Participants in 2 to 5

# How

```
(before the session)

Find a good candidate for a refactoring

Few examples:
- not in line with your guidelines
- with duplicated content
- with heavy content (method / class)
- with a lot of coupling
```

Discuss together and find an improvement idea:
- codebase test coverage: fill the gaps
- do the implementation (one person at a time, 2 or 3 minutes session)

Repeat

If possible, the refactoring must be reviewed by someone else and be integrated.

# Tips

Do not take a class poorly tested ; the session is about refactoring.
