# △ TRIANGLE △

## Target

With provided sides length, you must be able to tell:
- if the triangle is `valid?`
- if the triangle is `isosceles?`
- if the triangle is `equilateral?`
- if the triangle is `scalene?`

## Rules

A triangle is valid when:
- it has 3 positive sides length
- the sum of 2 sides must always be higher than the 3rd

A triangle is scalene when:
- it is valid,
- all the sides have different length

A triangle is isosceles when:
- it is valid,
- exactly 2 sides have the same length

A triangle is equilateral when:
- it is valid,
- all the 3 sides have the same length
