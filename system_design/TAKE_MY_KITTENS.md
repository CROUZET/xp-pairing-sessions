## Step 1: Birth

My cat just gave birth to 7 kittens, nobody in my relationship can adopt...

I need you to create a website to find people that can adopt them.
- a photo and a description of each kitten
- my contact

## Step 2: Opening

My kittens has been adopted but i'm receiving messages by people asking me to add their own kittens and contact informations!

We also need to show more cat caracteristics, multiple pictures and videos.

## Step 3: Popularity

We have more than 1000 uniq visitor / day ! The website is too slow now...

We have too much kittens, visitors must be able to search kittens by caracteristics, location
